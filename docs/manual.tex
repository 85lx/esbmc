\title{A manual on some internals of ESBMC}
\maketitle
\section{Introduction and caveats}

This ``manual'' is supposed to be an introduction to how the ESBMC model
checkers internals are arranged and operate. It is not supposed to be a
comprehensive piece of documentation on the exact behaviour of particular
functions or facilities; nor will it ever, ever be up to date. Exact
documentation on a particular function or method should be written in
doxygen in headers; this documentation can be built to HTML by executing
\texttt{make doxygen} in the top level directory of ESBMCs source tree.

When referencing portions of code from within this manual, I'll probably
end up referring to class names and methods within them. Source files and
line numbers are liable to change, wheras the code layout of the project
is the least likely to suffer significant churn. The location of such a
class or method should be obvious from the context, or discoverable with
grep. Numerous references will also be made to the \textit{Internal
representation}, or \textit{irep} of something. This refers to how some piece
of data is structured or stored, see the 'Misc' section for detail.

A huge amount of the code base is derived from the CBMC project. CBMC is
open source (BSD 4-clause, ish), and available over SVN at
\url{http://www.cprover.org/svn/cbmc}. A large number of design decisions
are down to the development of CBMC; changes to ESBMC that cause
significant divergance from CBMCs design should be carefully thought
about, seeing how it's more mature than ESBMC. Likewise, code being
pulled in from CBMC should be examined to see whether it'll actually fit
into what ESBMC is doing nowdays.

\end{description}

\section{Command line options}

Insert here, descriptions on command line options.

\section{Top level procedures}

Entry to the process starts (more or less) in the \texttt{doit} method of the
\texttt{cbmc\_parseoptionst} object. Various command line options are checked
for validity, before the \texttt{get\_goto\_program} method invokes the
frontend parsers to compile input source code into an AST. The AST for the
entire environment (all source files and libraries) is stored in a
\texttt{contextt} object, containing a list of symbols and their AST value.

The contents of the \texttt{contextt} object is passed to the
\texttt{goto\_convert} function, which produces a set of
\texttt{goto\_functiont}s corresponding to each function in the source language.
Each function contains little more than a \texttt{goto\_programt}, which
actually contain a list of instructions and some annotations.

With the set of GOTO functions, the \texttt{process\_goto\_program} method
applies the string abstraction transformation, the pointer analysis,
installs various pointer validity checks, and anything else that transforms
the source program into different instructions (such as LTL property monitors
or data race checking).

With these fixed-up goto functions, a \texttt{bmct} object is created and the
\texttt{run} method invoked on the functions. These functions are fed into a
\texttt{reachability\_treet} object, the primary interface to symbolic
execution. Within the \texttt{bmct::run} method, the symbolic execution engine
is asked to run through instructions creating an SSA program; potentially
several times if there are multiple threads involved. A result itself is a
\texttt{goto\_symext::symex\_resultt} containing the SSA program container and
a count of how many assertions remain to be verified in the program.

The SSA program is then optionally sliced; see the 'Misc' section for details.

A solver object is then created, a subclass of \texttt{bmct::solver\_base}
abstraction which solver to use. The SSA program is then fed to the solver,
which encodes it to SMT or whatever appropritate encoding it uses. It's then
asked to solve the equation, returning:
\begin{description}
\item[UNSATISFIABLE] The formula isn't satisfiable.
\item[SATISFIABLE] The formula is satisfiable.
\item[SMTLIB] A special case for printing the formula to a SMTLIB file.
\item[ERROR] Some error occured during solving.
\end{description}

Finally, if the formula is satisfiable, an error trace is created and printed.
Further details in the 'Misc' section.

\section{Source file parsing}

Code parsing is one of the untouched pastures of CBMC code, mostly. The ANSI-C
frontend is almost entirely like the original, while the C++ frontend has been
significantly developed by Manaus. The author is really familar with neither.
I'll talk about the ANSI-C frontend, then how the C++ frontend relates to it.

There are some significant conceptual steps involved. Firstly consider
the input and the output. Coming in is a C source file that must be preprocessed
and parsed - two fairly straightforward (although not easy) tasks. The top
levels of ESBMC then receive an AST representing the types and code structure
of the source file, which is more complex. The irep / structure of this data
is entirely undocumented and closely coupled between the parsers and the
\texttt{goto-programs} dir that converts it to GOTO instructions. However the
contents of this AST tends to be fairly high level language constructs,
for example \texttt{for} and \texttt{switch} statements. Refer to the method
\texttt{goto\_convertt:convert} for an idea of what kind of constructs these
are. The majority of the source file parsing code deals with converting between
the parse tree and the AST.

The preprocessing stage is contained in the \texttt{c\_preprocess} function.
In CBMC this used to offload preprocessing to the host preprocessor, however
our requirements have become more complicated since then. We now do
preprocessing using the preprocessor from the Portable C Compiler project
(which is BSD licensed). Unfortunately it wasn't designed with memory management
in mind, so ESBMC picks an output file, forks, calls the preprocessor to pump
outupt to the selected file, then exits the child process.

The complicated requirements from the preprocessor is that we generally want
code under test to have access to all headers on the host system, however we
also want to shoehorn our own types and functions in there --- for example the
glibc headers for assert have some obnoxious defines involved. Additionally
given how much lee-way standards give to libraries to define the format of
opaque data structures, we may need to define our own data structures to
avoid having to special case code for different operating systems. For example,
\texttt{pthread\_t}'s, \texttt{pthread\_mutex\_lock}'s and so forth differ
between operating systems, and we currently rely on on using Linux' pthread.h
header. The current fix for this is to intercept \texttt{\#include} statements
and read in an ESBMC specific header file from \texttt{ansi-c/headers} rather
than the system headers.

We parse C in the normal way; a flex tokenizer is defined, and a yacc grammar
defined which translate the input C into a parse tree. This needs no special
description. A class (\texttt{ansi\_c\_convertt}) takes the parse tree and
makes a simple translation to the format of the AST. The bulk of the work then
lies in the \textit{typechecking} phase. Here, the nasty parts of C that are
context-dependant\footnote{i.e., all of them} are fixed up. Factors such as
integer promotion, operation signedness, and actual correctness are
considered, and various casts or extensions are inserted. The output is stored
as a set of symbols with associated AST values in a \texttt{contextt} object.

After parsing and compilation is linking. In the past CBMC has just
tacked all libraries available onto the end of a source file being compiled,
and that's all. Nowdays the libraries are pre-compiled into a binary
representation of GOTO instructions, and linked in after typechecking of C
code, by copying in any symbol referred to from the compiled source files
that are in the compiled library files.

Finally there's the initialization of C global and static lifetime variables.
Seeing how the GOTO language is only made up of assignments, ish, their
initialization must be made by assignments too. So, an initial 'main' GOTO
function is synthesized from the \texttt{c\_main} and
\texttt{static\_lifetime\_init} functions. For each global variable an
assignment is emitted assigning the initial value to the global variable.

\section{GOTO programs}

This section covers both the GOTO program record itself, and the GOTO
instructions that make it up. Before launching into a description of these
records, it is important to understand that CBMC synthesizes the
\texttt{goto\_programt} class from the \texttt{goto\_program\_templatet}
template. This can lead to the most confusing and obscure error messages
if you do not realise that you're manipulating a template. From a design
point of view, the reason for this appears to be so that the types of
the GOTO program body could be parameterised; a decision that is almost
entirely without merit.

The \texttt{goto\_programt} class is more or less just a container for a
list of GOTO instructions (of class \texttt{goto\_programt::instructiont}).
It stores \textbf{no} additional information. Instead, all of its methods
perform operations on the contained instructions. Most of these relate
to the creation, insertion, and deletion of instructions, recalculating
their contents to be consistent after such a modification, and a few
special cases such as determining the successor instructions from a
particular instruction,

The actual GOTO instruction class itself's primary piece of data comes in
two flavours -- the \texttt{code} member or the \texttt{guard} member.
These store the internal representation of what the body of the instruction
\textit{is}. Exactly what the instruction means depends on the \texttt{type}
field, described thus:

\begin{description}
\item[GOTO] Jump from the current instruction to the instruction in the
\texttt{targets} field. If \texttt{guard} is not true, then the jump is
conditional, depending on the evaluation of \texttt{guard}. If \texttt{guard}
is true the jump to the target occurs; if not, execution continues to the next
instruction.
\item[ASSUME] Encode an assumption, stored in the \texttt{guard} field, to the
solver.
\item[ASSERT] Encode an assertion, stored in the \texttt{guard} field, to the
solver.
\item[OTHER] Catch-all instruction for storing special cases, enumerated below.
Identified by what kind of irep is stored in the \texttt{code} field.
\begin{description}
\item[cpp\_delete] Also \texttt{cpp\_delete[]}. Represents a deallocation of
some memory allocated by C++'s \texttt{new} or \texttt{new[]} operators.
\item[printf]\footnote{Yes, really} Represents a printf operation, for later
printing in a counterexample.
\item[decl] Represent declaration of a variable. Normally the declaration of
a variable is uninteresting as we only care about when it is initialized.
However in a loop where a variable is declared inside the loop block, it
transitions from being initialized to uninitialized when the loop iteration
finishes. Hence the importance of knowing where it is declared.
\item[nondet] Represent a nondeterministic value, from a \texttt{nondet\_*}
function call.
\item[asm] Inline assembly statement. Mercifully ignored.
\item[typeid] Fetch a C++ type ID record, I belive.
\end{description}
\item[SKIP] An ignored instruction.
\item[LOCATION] Previously caused a ``location'' SSA step to be recorded for
future tracking of the code path of the counterexample. Now redundant.
\item[END\_FUNCTION] End instruction of a function. Not the same as a return,
which can occur anywhere, but actually the final instruction in the list of
instructions.
\item[ATOMIC\_BEGIN] Self explanatory.
\item[ATOMIC\_END] Self explanatory.
\item[RETURN] Record a return statement, identifying the expression to return.
Stored in a ``return'' irep in the \texttt{code} field.
\item[ASSIGN] Self explanatory. An ``assign'' irep is stored in the
\texttt{code} field, identifying the left and right hand sides.
\item[DECL] Unused. Probably used to be, or was intended to be, the decl
irep from the OTHER instruction.
\item[DEAD] Unused. Comments say ``marks the end-of-live of a local variable''.
\item[FUNCTION\_CALL] A function call record; stores a function call irep in
the \texttt{code} field, which in turn records the left hand side of the call,
the arguments, and the target.
\item[THROW] Throw record; not familiar with this, but it'll result in some
kind of an assignment to a record of what's been thrown, and a jump to somewhere
else.
\item[THROW\_DECL] Record the start of a catch block for a particular type
of variable.
\item[THROW\_DECL] Record the end of a catch block for a particular type
of variable.
\end{description}

All behaviours of GOTO programs are described by lists of these instructions.
Additional annotations are stored with each instruction, for example the
\texttt{function} and \texttt{location} fields identify where in the source
files the instruction came from. The \texttt{targets} list contains a list
of where the instruction can jump to (which should only ever contain zero or
one target instructions).

\texttt{loop\_number} identifies a unique loop number for backwards
GOTO instructions. \texttt{target\_number} is a numeric ID that labels
the instruction within a function. This don't actually do anything, but
is printed in the textual representation of GOTO instructions to indicate
the targets of GOTOs.  There's also a set of local variable names, and
a globally unique instruction ID in \texttt{location\_number}.

That's the substance of instructions; more information on the interpretation
of them lies in the symbolic execution section.
