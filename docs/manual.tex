\title{A manual on some internals of ESBMC}
\maketitle
\section{Introduction and caveats}

This ``manual'' is supposed to be an introduction to how the ESBMC model
checkers internals are arranged and operate. It is not supposed to be a
comprehensive piece of documentation on the exact behaviour of particular
functions or facilities; nor will it ever, ever be up to date. Exact
documentation on a particular function or method should be written in
doxygen in headers; this documentation can be built to HTML by executing
\texttt{make doxygen} in the top level directory of ESBMCs source tree.

When referencing portions of code from within this manual, I'll probably
end up referring to class names and methods within them. Source files and
line numbers are liable to change, wheras the code layout of the project
is the least likely to suffer significant churn. The location of such a
class or method should be obvious from the context, or discoverable with
grep. Numerous references will also be made to the \textit{Internal
representation}, or \textit{irep} of something. This refers to how some piece
of data is structured or stored, see the 'Misc' section for detail.

A huge amount of the code base is derived from the CBMC project. CBMC is
open source (BSD 4-clause, ish), and available over SVN at
\url{http://www.cprover.org/svn/cbmc}. A large number of design decisions
are down to the development of CBMC; changes to ESBMC that cause
significant divergance from CBMCs design should be carefully thought
about, seeing how it's more mature than ESBMC. Likewise, code being
pulled in from CBMC should be examined to see whether it'll actually fit
into what ESBMC is doing nowdays.

\end{description}

\section{Command line options}

Insert here, descriptions on command line options.

\section{Top level procedures}

Entry to the process starts (more or less) in the \texttt{doit} method of the
\texttt{cbmc\_parseoptionst} object. Various command line options are checked
for validity, before the \texttt{get\_goto\_program} method invokes the
frontend parsers to compile input source code into an AST. The AST for the
entire environment (all source files and libraries) is stored in a
\texttt{contextt} object, containing a list of symbols and their AST value.

The contents of the \texttt{contextt} object is passed to the
\texttt{goto\_convert} function, which produces a set of
\texttt{goto\_functiont}s corresponding to each function in the source language.
Each function contains little more than a \texttt{goto\_programt}, which
actually contain a list of instructions and some annotations.

With the set of GOTO functions, the \texttt{process\_goto\_program} method
applies the string abstraction transformation, the pointer analysis,
installs various pointer validity checks, and anything else that transforms
the source program into different instructions (such as LTL property monitors
or data race checking).

With these fixed-up goto functions, a \texttt{bmct} object is created and the
\texttt{run} method invoked on the functions. These functions are fed into a
\texttt{reachability\_treet} object, the primary interface to symbolic
execution. Within the \texttt{bmct::run} method, the symbolic execution engine
is asked to run through instructions creating an SSA program; potentially
several times if there are multiple threads involved. A result itself is a
\texttt{goto\_symext::symex\_resultt} containing the SSA program container and
a count of how many assertions remain to be verified in the program.

The SSA program is then optionally sliced; see the 'Misc' section for details.

A solver object is then created, a subclass of \texttt{bmct::solver\_base}
abstraction which solver to use. The SSA program is then fed to the solver,
which encodes it to SMT or whatever appropritate encoding it uses. It's then
asked to solve the equation, returning:
\begin{description}
\item[UNSATISFIABLE] The formula isn't satisfiable.
\item[SATISFIABLE] The formula is satisfiable.
\item[SMTLIB] A special case for printing the formula to a SMTLIB file.
\item[ERROR] Some error occured during solving.
\end{description}

Finally, if the formula is satisfiable, an error trace is created and printed.
Further details in the 'Misc' section.

\section{Source file parsing}

Code parsing is one of the untouched pastures of CBMC code, mostly. The ANSI-C
frontend is almost entirely like the original, while the C++ frontend has been
significantly developed by Manaus. The author is really familar with neither.
I'll talk about the ANSI-C frontend, then how the C++ frontend relates to it.

There are some significant conceptual steps involved. Firstly consider
the input and the output. Coming in is a C source file that must be preprocessed
and parsed - two fairly straightforward (although not easy) tasks. The top
levels of ESBMC then receive an AST representing the types and code structure
of the source file, which is more complex. The irep / structure of this data
is entirely undocumented and closely coupled between the parsers and the
\texttt{goto-programs} dir that converts it to GOTO instructions. However the
contents of this AST tends to be fairly high level language constructs,
for example \texttt{for} and \texttt{switch} statements. Refer to the method
\texttt{goto\_convertt:convert} for an idea of what kind of constructs these
are. The majority of the source file parsing code deals with converting between
the parse tree and the AST.

The preprocessing stage is contained in the \texttt{c\_preprocess} function.
In CBMC this used to offload preprocessing to the host preprocessor, however
our requirements have become more complicated since then. We now do
preprocessing using the preprocessor from the Portable C Compiler project
(which is BSD licensed). Unfortunately it wasn't designed with memory management
in mind, so ESBMC picks an output file, forks, calls the preprocessor to pump
outupt to the selected file, then exits the child process.

The complicated requirements from the preprocessor is that we generally want
code under test to have access to all headers on the host system, however we
also want to shoehorn our own types and functions in there --- for example the
glibc headers for assert have some obnoxious defines involved. Additionally
given how much lee-way standards give to libraries to define the format of
opaque data structures, we may need to define our own data structures to
avoid having to special case code for different operating systems. For example,
\texttt{pthread\_t}'s, \texttt{pthread\_mutex\_lock}'s and so forth differ
between operating systems, and we currently rely on on using Linux' pthread.h
header. The current fix for this is to intercept \texttt{\#include} statements
and read in an ESBMC specific header file from \texttt{ansi-c/headers} rather
than the system headers.

We parse C in the normal way; a flex tokenizer is defined, and a yacc grammar
defined which translate the input C into a parse tree. This needs no special
description. A class (\texttt{ansi\_c\_convertt}) takes the parse tree and
makes a simple translation to the format of the AST. The bulk of the work then
lies in the \textit{typechecking} phase. Here, the nasty parts of C that are
context-dependant\footnote{i.e., all of them} are fixed up. Factors such as
integer promotion, operation signedness, and actual correctness are
considered, and various casts or extensions are inserted. The output is stored
as a set of symbols with associated AST values in a \texttt{contextt} object.

After parsing and compilation is linking. In the past CBMC has just
tacked all libraries available onto the end of a source file being compiled,
and that's all. Nowdays the libraries are pre-compiled into a binary
representation of GOTO instructions, and linked in after typechecking of C
code, by copying in any symbol referred to from the compiled source files
that are in the compiled library files.

Finally there's the initialization of C global and static lifetime variables.
Seeing how the GOTO language is only made up of assignments, ish, their
initialization must be made by assignments too. So, an initial 'main' GOTO
function is synthesized from the \texttt{c\_main} and
\texttt{static\_lifetime\_init} functions. For each global variable an
assignment is emitted assigning the initial value to the global variable.

\section{GOTO programs}

This section covers both the GOTO program record itself, and the GOTO
instructions that make it up. Before launching into a description of these
records, it is important to understand that CBMC synthesizes the
\texttt{goto\_programt} class from the \texttt{goto\_program\_templatet}
template. This can lead to the most confusing and obscure error messages
if you do not realise that you're manipulating a template. From a design
point of view, the reason for this appears to be so that the types of
the GOTO program body could be parameterised; a decision that is almost
entirely without merit.

The \texttt{goto\_programt} class is more or less just a container for a
list of GOTO instructions (of class \texttt{goto\_programt::instructiont}).
It stores \textbf{no} additional information. Instead, all of its methods
perform operations on the contained instructions. Most of these relate
to the creation, insertion, and deletion of instructions, recalculating
their contents to be consistent after such a modification, and a few
special cases such as determining the successor instructions from a
particular instruction,

The actual GOTO instruction class itself's primary piece of data comes in
two flavours -- the \texttt{code} member or the \texttt{guard} member.
These store the internal representation of what the body of the instruction
\textit{is}. Exactly what the instruction means depends on the \texttt{type}
field, described thus:

\begin{description}
\item[GOTO] Jump from the current instruction to the instruction in the
\texttt{targets} field. If \texttt{guard} is not true, then the jump is
conditional, depending on the evaluation of \texttt{guard}. If \texttt{guard}
is true the jump to the target occurs; if not, execution continues to the next
instruction.
\item[ASSUME] Encode an assumption, stored in the \texttt{guard} field, to the
solver.
\item[ASSERT] Encode an assertion, stored in the \texttt{guard} field, to the
solver.
\item[OTHER] Catch-all instruction for storing special cases, enumerated below.
Identified by what kind of irep is stored in the \texttt{code} field.
\begin{description}
\item[cpp\_delete] Also \texttt{cpp\_delete[]}. Represents a deallocation of
some memory allocated by C++'s \texttt{new} or \texttt{new[]} operators.
\item[printf]\footnote{Yes, really} Represents a printf operation, for later
printing in a counterexample.
\item[decl] Represent declaration of a variable. Normally the declaration of
a variable is uninteresting as we only care about when it is initialized.
However in a loop where a variable is declared inside the loop block, it
transitions from being initialized to uninitialized when the loop iteration
finishes. Hence the importance of knowing where it is declared.
\item[nondet] Represent a nondeterministic value, from a \texttt{nondet\_*}
function call.
\item[asm] Inline assembly statement. Mercifully ignored.
\item[typeid] Fetch a C++ type ID record, I belive.
\end{description}
\item[SKIP] An ignored instruction.
\item[LOCATION] Previously caused a ``location'' SSA step to be recorded for
future tracking of the code path of the counterexample. Now redundant.
\item[END\_FUNCTION] End instruction of a function. Not the same as a return,
which can occur anywhere, but actually the final instruction in the list of
instructions.
\item[ATOMIC\_BEGIN] Self explanatory.
\item[ATOMIC\_END] Self explanatory.
\item[RETURN] Record a return statement, identifying the expression to return.
Stored in a ``return'' irep in the \texttt{code} field.
\item[ASSIGN] Self explanatory. An ``assign'' irep is stored in the
\texttt{code} field, identifying the left and right hand sides.
\item[DECL] Unused. Probably used to be, or was intended to be, the decl
irep from the OTHER instruction.
\item[DEAD] Unused. Comments say ``marks the end-of-live of a local variable''.
\item[FUNCTION\_CALL] A function call record; stores a function call irep in
the \texttt{code} field, which in turn records the left hand side of the call,
the arguments, and the target.
\item[THROW] Throw record; not familiar with this, but it'll result in some
kind of an assignment to a record of what's been thrown, and a jump to somewhere
else.
\item[THROW\_DECL] Record the start of a catch block for a particular type
of variable.
\item[THROW\_DECL] Record the end of a catch block for a particular type
of variable.
\end{description}

All behaviours of GOTO programs are described by lists of these instructions.
Additional annotations are stored with each instruction, for example the
\texttt{function} and \texttt{location} fields identify where in the source
files the instruction came from. The \texttt{targets} list contains a list
of where the instruction can jump to (which should only ever contain zero or
one target instructions).

\texttt{loop\_number} identifies a unique loop number for backwards
GOTO instructions. \texttt{target\_number} is a numeric ID that labels
the instruction within a function. This don't actually do anything, but
is printed in the textual representation of GOTO instructions to indicate
the targets of GOTOs.  There's also a set of local variable names, and
a globally unique instruction ID in \texttt{location\_number}.

That's the substance of instructions; more information on the interpretation
of them lies in the symbolic execution section.

\section{Pointer analysis}

The essence of the pointer analysis is a tracking of what pointer variables
exist in the GOTO code, and what they might point at. This occurs more than once
during each run of ESBMC. A static analysis of the instructions first attempts
to establish a set of all (lexical) variables that a particular (lexical)
variable in a function may point at. Then during symbolic execution, a similar
tracking maintains a set of (``runtime'') variables that an actual pointer
\textit{does} point at.

The static analysis is initiated from the GOTO program processing code in the
\texttt{cbmc\_parseoptionst} object. The high level analysis logic actually
lies in the \texttt{goto-programs} directory with the
\texttt{static\_analysist} and \texttt{abstract\_domain\_baset}
classes. Code in these classes call abstract methods to perform transformations 
between states as appropriate, over all GOTO instructions, to find a fixedpoint
where all values of the abstract domain have been discovered for all states.

The \texttt{value\_set\_analysist} and \texttt{value\_set\_domaint} classes
subclass the above two classes respectively to provide concrete
methods\footnote{I'm probably using all the wrong terminology here} for
tracking states of what pointer variables might point at. Most of the logic
itself lies in the latter class, storing both the actually tracking data
and forwarding transformation method calls to the appropriate objects.

A \texttt{value\_set\_domaint} contains only a \texttt{value\_sett} object.
That itself contains the pointer tracking map, which is, unsuprisingly,
string based. The core type is the \texttt{value\_sett::valuest} map,
where a string identifying a variable name maps to a
\texttt{value\_sett::entryt}, which stores a set of variables that may be
pointed at and the offset into them.

The string key of each of these entries is important -- When interpreting 
an assignment of a pointer value to a variable, we take the original variable
name being worked on and then interpret the left hand side, appending strings
to indicate /what/ part of the variable is being assigned to. To illustrate,
consider an assignment to the \texttt{bees} field of the following struct:
\begin{lstlisting}
struct face {
  void *bees[4];
};

int main() {
  struct face knees;
  knees.bees[0] = NULL;
  return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}

Here, the fully qualified name of the variable we are assigning to is
\texttt{main::main::knees}, which becomes the starting point for the string
key in the value tracking map. We then interpret the left hand side of the
assignment, observe that we access the \texttt{bees} field, and so append the
text \texttt{.bees} to the key we are calculating. The next part of the left
hand side is the access to an element of the \texttt{bees} array, so we
append the text \texttt{[]} to the key we calculate. The final key is then
\texttt{main::main::knees.bees[]}. Observe that this approach allows every
variable in the program to have a unique key in the tracking map, except for
elements in an array --- we instead track what \textit{all} elements of the
array may point at, thus forming an overapproximation. The reasons for this
should be obvious.

The \texttt{value\_sett::entryt} class is responsible for tracking the target
variables that a pointer may point at. It stores a map between certain variable
names and \texttt{value\_sett::objectt}s. The presence of a variable name key
in the map indicates that the variable may be pointed at. The
\texttt{value\_sett::objectt} object records whether the offset into the
variable that is pointed at is nondeterministic or constant; and if fixed,
then what the offset is. (NB: the actual implementation of this stores
\texttt{symbol} ireps as the map keys. To optimise this, it uses a (global)
pooling technique to assign each irep an ID number; see the
\texttt{value\_sett::object\_numbering} object. The ID number is then used
as the key into the \texttt{value\_sett::entryt} map).

The \texttt{value\_sett} class also provides operations required in the course
of the static analysis, most importantly the ability to interpret an instruction
to record and update the tracking described above. The class can also merge
value set records into each other. This follows the obvious merging procedure;
however when the two tracking sets being merged have a pointer variable
that points at different offsets into the same data object, the merged
tracking set records a nondeterministic offset into that data object. This
forms an overapproximation of the offset into an object that a pointer points
at.

No attempt is made to track what I'll term \textit{funky} pointer assignments.
For example, if code deconstructs a pointer variable into bytes, then
reconstructs these bytes into a pointer value, we are unable to track
what the resulting pointer value points at. How to address this in the future
is an open question. The byte array memory models of other tools neatly
side-step this issue.

The static analysis process eventually reaches a fixedpoint state where we
have established all possible variables that may be pointed at byte pointer
variables. The contents of this analysis is then handed to an object of
class \texttt{goto\_program\_dereference}. This proceeds to enumerate all
GOTO instructions and attempts to perform all dereferences in the instruction.
Pointer safety assertions are then generated (see the section on dereferencing)
and inserted as ASSERT instructions prior to the dereferencing instruction.

The pointer analysis executed during symbolic execution uses the same records
and functions as the static analysis. While the static analysis attempts to find
all the variables a pointer might point at across all code paths, the symex
tracking instead tracks the set of all variables a pointer may point at in the
course of the current code path. The variables it tracks are also ``L1 renamed''
(see the section on Symbolic Execution).

It is speculated that the static analysis can be removed, and assertions
encoded on-the-fly when dereferences occur during symbolic execution. While
this might be a valid optimisation, the TACAS13 performance figures indicate
that execution time is dominated by symex, rather than the pointer
analysis\footnote{660 seconds ``GOTO processing'' compared to 20,000 seconds
``BMC time''}.

\section{Symbolic execution}

This portion of ESBMC is likely the most important in terms of theory,
complexity, and performance. The overall task is to take an input set of
GOTO functions, and interpret their instructions through an execution path
that is bounded according to the rules of BMC. Along the way, a \textit{Single
Static Assignment} (SSA) program is created recording the operations that
occured during the trace, for later checking. We must also make decisions
regarding the exploration of thread interleavings if multiple threads are
involved. To cover this section, we'll first look at the substance of the
SSA program, the concept of variable ``renaming'', the classes that make up
the symex process, how specific instructions are interpreted in single
threaded code including certain special case library functions,
and finally how all this relates to multi-threaded code.

\subsection{SSA programs}

The output from a single symex run through a program is contained in a
\texttt{symex\_target\_equationt} object. This primarily stores a list of
\texttt{symex\_target\_equationt::SSA\_stept} objects, each of which represents
a single operation in program, sometimes referred to as a \textit{trace}.
The idea of SSA \textit{variables} will be discussed in the ``Variable
Renaming'' section. A SSA step comes in four flavours:

\begin{description}
\item[ASSIGNMENT] An assignment to a variable, with a symbol on the left hand
side, and an expression irep on the right hand side.
\item[ASSERT] Represent an assertion that an expression evaluates to true.
\item[ASSUME] Represent an assumption that an expression evaluates to true.
\item[OUTPUT] Record an output from the trace. This is essentially a wrapper
around a printf operation, that causes variables to be printed in the
course of printing a counterexample. I recommend not asking.
\end{description}

Numerous expression fields in a step object record the details of the above
operations, and are generally uninteresting for this discussion. The only
other data of note is that each step stores a \texttt{source} object, recording
where in the GOTO program the SSA step was generated.

\subsection{Variable renaming}

FIXME: this section is likely worded in a cack handed manner, requires
verification.

In the course of this manual there are numerous references to ``variables'',
without futher elaboration. The different aspects of variables that might be
referred to are below:

\begin{itemize}
\item The lexical variable, i.e. the variable name itself in a particular
context, not specific to a particular value or function activation.
\item The storage of a variable. The portion of memory reserved for storing
the value of a variable, either a global variable or memory allocated on the
stack if an automatically allocated variable in a function block.
\item The contents of a variable. Simply the value assigned to the variable
at a particular point in a program.
\end{itemize}

We name these different aspects \textit{level 0}, \textit{level 1}, and
\textit{level 2} respectively, often shortened to L0, L1, or L2. The reason
for this naming will become obvious shortly. An example is in order to fully
understand this. Consider the following function, and how it relates to the
pointer analysis:

\lstset{numbers=left}
\begin{lstlisting}
int anint;

void somefunc(int **beans) {
  int *bears = *beans;
  bears = &anint;
}

int main1(void) {
  int wololololo = 0;
  somefunc(&wololololo);
}

int main2(void) {
  int ponies = 0;
  somefunc(&ponies);
}
\end{lstlisting}

Here, if we consider the variable \texttt{beans} as an L0 variable, what it
points at is the set of all pointer targets it could potentially point at over
\textit{all} execution traces that are available in the program, including
all pointers that may be fed into \texttt{somefunc} at any point in the
program. This set includes the \texttt{wololololo} and \texttt{ponies}
variables. However if we consider \texttt{beans} as an L1 variable, what it
points at is whatever it may point at across the lifetime of its storage. Thus,
this depends on the path taken through the program -- the pointer may point
at \texttt{wololololo} or \texttt{anint} if \texttt{somefunc} is called from
\texttt{main1}, or alternately it may point at \texttt{ponies} or \texttt{anint}
if called from \texttt{main2}. However it may never potentially point at all
three. Finally, L2 variables are the actual value of the variable at a
particular point in the program, in our example the L2 \texttt{beans} pointer
may only ever point at a single value, which varies with both the path through
the program and the actual instruction location.

(These differences are important during the pointer analysis -- the static
analysis tracks pointers as L0 variables, the symex pointer tracking considers
L1 variables).

The reason for describing these variable kinds in terms of ``level''s, is
that we can consider a higher ``level'' of variable as representing a set of
lower level variables. Consider: if we call the \texttt{somefunc} function
in the above example three times, then the L0 \texttt{beans} variable exists
only once (as the function only exists once, so the lexical variable exists
once). However, three L1 instances of the L1 \texttt{beans} variable exist,
because the function was called three times and storage allocated for the
variable three times. In the same way, repeated assignment to a variable
in a function causes only one L1 name to exist (as only one piece of storage
is required), however multiple L2 variables exist as the variable has
multiple values during the execution of the function.

This then leads to the concept of ``renaming'', which is where we take a high
level variable and reference a lower level variable, appropriate to the context.
The two forms this can take are the transitions L0 to L1, and L1 to L2. In the
former case, we are taking a lexical variable and referring to the actual
storage of that variable. If the variable is global or of a static lifetime,
no additional data is added to the record, as the variable is always the
same piece of storage across the whole program execution. If the variable is
allocated local to a function call, then the L0 variable is annotated with
a unique \textit{activation record} number that identifies which invocation
of the function we are dealing with, and a thread number. The actual values
of these numbers are derived from the context of the renaming -- a thread number
is always available, and the activation record number of the function is always
available (as it's illegal to refer to a local variable outside of its
scope\footnote{Indirect pointer references are special, see later}.


When renaming an L1 variable to an L2 variable (effectively finding the value
currently stored by that L1 variable) we annotate the L1 variable with
a context switch ID number (see later sections) and an \textit{SSA assignment
number}. The assignment number is a monotonically increasing counter giving each
assignment to an L1 variable a unique identifier. So, if we assign to a
variable four times in a function, four L2 variables are created with
assignment numbers from one to four. This preserves the SSA constraint that we
only ever assign to a variable once. When renaming an L1 variable to L2 for the
purpose of using its value rather than making an assignment, we take the
assignment number to be the greatest assignment number for that L1 variable,
thus giving us the most recently assigned value of that L1 variable.

The final complexity to this situation, is that there is never a particular
object in ESBMC that represents any of these variables. Instead, variables
are identified by \textit{name}, stored in a symbol irep. Unsuprisingly, this
name is a string\footnote{Changes in the irep2 branch}. Multiple symbol irep
objects can contain the name of the same variable; creating a new variable
at any leve is as simple as creating a new name. An interesting side-effect
of this is that, following the procedure for renaming an L1 variable to L2,
if the L1 variable has never been assigned to then the greatest assignment
number is zero, and so references to unassigned variables read from assignment
number zero. (And because when we reach the solver level there is nothing
constraining the zeroth assignment of that variable, it's a free variable).
The format of this string is as follows:

\begin{quote}
full\_variable\_name@actv\_record!thread\_no\&cswitch\_no\#assign\_no
\end{quote}

Where \texttt{actv\_record}, \texttt{thread\_no}, \texttt{cswitch\_no}, and
\texttt{assign\_no} are replaced with the appropriate numbers. L0 names only
feature the variable name at the start; L1 names follow the above format
up until the ampersand; and L2 names use the full format. These names will
frequently crop up throughout almost all of ESBMC.

\subsection{Class overview}

The top level class for symex is \texttt{reachability\_treet}. This contains,
at some level, all the state involved in the interpretation of GOTO
instructions. It also has the high level entry-to-symex methods like
\texttt{reachability\_treet::get\_next\_formula}. Almost all the actual
logic in the class is related to the exploration of multithreaded interleavings,
everything symex related exists in lower level classes. The main piece of
data stored is a set of \texttt{execution\_statet}'s, each of which stores
the full state of the program at a particular point in time.

The next two classes of interest are the \texttt{goto\_symext} and its
subclass, \texttt{execution\_statet}. The former contains all the logic
for GOTO interpretation and anything else only related to single threaded
execution, plus stores a few parameters for symex exploration. The latter
overrides a number of methods and injects logic for discovering when
multithreading operations must occur. The logic in this class only relates
to operations on the program state rather than interleaving exploration.
It stores a set of thread state objects, of class
\texttt{goto\_symex\_statet}, while some specialised information is broken out
into \texttt{execution\_statet} for easy accessibility (such as what threads
are still running, atomic blocks, startup parameters). Global program state
is also stored here as a \texttt{value\_sett} object to track pointer value
sets, and a \texttt{renaming::level2t} storing data on the latest assignments
to variables.

Within the \texttt{goto\_symex\_statet} class are all thread specific pieces
of data --- things like the program counter (in
\texttt{symex\_targett::sourcet}) or the call stack (in
\texttt{goto\_symex\_statet::framet}). Significantly more state is stored
tracking the nondeterministic exploration of the program.
\texttt{goto\_symex\_statet::goto\_statet} objects contain the whole program
state resulting from a short deterministic path, which are then merged together
where control paths merge\footnote{i.e., SSA phi functions} to form the
nondeterministic program trace. Various objects of \texttt{guardt} class
record the guard of a particular path being taken. Also stored is the count
of how many times a loop has been unwound in the current context, for the
purpose of loop bounding.

A \texttt{goto\_symex\_statet::framet} stores information related to a
particular stack frame / function activation. Mundane facts like the function
name, call site location, return value variable and the names of local variables
live here. More exciting items such as the set of executions to be merged in
the future, and the actvation record number for renaming, live here too.
There are also some hacks related to function pointer interpretation.

\subsection{Instruction interpretation}

The execution of instructions begins in the constructor for
\texttt{execution\_statet} where the first thread is created and its program
counter set to the entry of the \texttt{main} function. From that point
onwards, the \texttt{goto\_symext::symex\_step} method is repeatedly called
to take the next instruction, interpret it, and move forwards. Some
instructions are handled in \texttt{execution\_statet::symex\_step},
which overrides its superclass and interprets multithreading specific
instructions. What follows is a narative of the (not quite) high level
operations performed during the interpretation of these instructions. Assume
that pointer dereferences are already handled as described in the section
on dereferencing --- actions specific to dereferencing will be mentioned
explicitly.

\subsubsection{Assign}

The substance of an assignment is a left hand side and right hand side. The
outcome we need is an SSA assignment, where we calculate a value with a type
n the right hand side, and then create a new left hand side variable that this
right hand side can be bound to. Clearly the assignment of a constant rhs to
a variable on the lhs is the simplest example of this. The operation becomes
more complex when the left hand side is an array index, a struct field,
a cast, or a nondeterminstic symbol due to pointer dereferencing. These
assignments must be rewritten into a simple variable assignment.

Performing this rewriting for an array index, we take the array variable
on the left hand side, and create a WITH operation that updates the desired
element with the right hand side. The assignment is rewritten to become an
assignment of this new value to the array variable. A similar operation
occurs for struct and union member assignments. For a nondeterministic
assignment we encode multiple deterministic assignments, one for each left
hand side, guarded by the appropriate guard. For assignment to a
\texttt{byte\_extract} irep, we replace the right hand side with a
\texttt{byte\_update} irep of the base data object on the left hand side.
The logic for all these operations begins in the
\texttt{goto\_symext::symex\_assign\_rec} method and methods called from there.

Once we have an assignment in this form it is suitable for being an SSA
assignment. However all the variables are L0 variables, and need to be
renamed to refer to the appropriate piece of data or value. In the course
of the \texttt{goto\_symext::symex\_assign\_symbol} method we call
\texttt{goto\_symex\_statet::rename} which identifies each variable on the
right hand side, renames to L1 (storage variables), and then to L2 (actual
values). The identifying numbers for these operations are pulled from the
top level \texttt{goto\_symex\_statet::framet} object of the most recently
called function, and the global L2 state tracking. One notable exception here
is that any operand to an \texttt{address\_of} operation will only be renamed
to L1 --- we do not take the address of a particular variable value, but
instead the storage of the variable.

Once renamed, execution passes to \texttt{goto\_symex\_statet::assignment},
which performs accounting for the assignment on the L2 level. Specifically,
it bumps the SSA assignment number for the variable assigned to, so that future
uses of it will have the updated / recently assigned value. Additionally
we inspect the contents of the right hand side, and if it is a
sufficiently\textsuperscript{\texttrademark} constant value it is cached
in the program L2 state tracking, for constant propagation. Future rename
operations on that variable will have the variable replaced with its constant
value, rather than the variable itself. This method also passes the
assignment to be interpreted by the pointer analysis, which updates what the
left hand side may possibly point at.

Finally the \texttt{symex\_target\_equationt::assignment} method is called
to encode an SSA assignment, the program counter is incremented to point at the
next instruction, and we are done.

\subsubsection{Assert and assume}

ASSERT and ASSUME instructions are no-where near complex. Their substance
is the \texttt{guard} field of the GOTO instruction, which records the condition
that we are asserting or assuming. This expression is renamed as above to refer
to the appropriate L2 or L1 variables, and is passed to the expression
simplifier in case we can determine the truth of the operation statically.
The time and particularly memory benefits of determining this early are
significant.

The relevant methods are \texttt{goto\_symext::claim} for ASSERT and
\texttt{goto\_symext::assume} for ASSUME. These perform the above operations,
and then call \texttt{symex\_target\_equationt::assertion} and
\texttt{symex\_target\_equationt::assumption} respectively.
