EXPERIMENTAL Stuff. Things that should ideally turn up here:
 * Documentation and other introductory stuff to python mangling
 * Any reasonably large piece of python code we write
 * Runtime support for people who want to write things in python and use
   facilities that don't make sense in C++
 * A monument to boost.python and the slightly sketchy way it works

Requires esbmc.so to be linked into cwd
